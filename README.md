In this taxi service, drivers are required to ensure that the kilometer meter accurately reflects the distance traveled during each ride. This means that the meter must be in accordance with the actual distance traveled, or be within a certain tolerance (e.g. within a certain percentage above or below the actual distance). If the meter is not in accordance with the actual distance traveled, the driver will not be eligible to receive their reward for that ride.

The taxi service uses Plutus as its main payment system, which means that drivers have the option to receive their rewards in a variety of different currencies, including traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Plutus offers fast and secure payment processing, as well as low transaction fees, which may help to improve efficiency and reduce costs for the business and its drivers. Additionally, using a cryptocurrency-based payment system may offer greater financial inclusion and accessibility, as it allows individuals and businesses to participate in the global economy regardless of their location or financial status.

This requirement is in place to ensure fairness and accuracy in the payment system. By requiring the meter to be in accordance with the actual distance traveled, the taxi service can accurately calculate the cost of each ride and fairly compensate the driver for their time and effort. Additionally, this requirement helps to prevent fraud or dishonest behavior by drivers, as it ensures that they cannot manipulate the meter in order to receive an inflated payment.

Overall, this payment system is designed to ensure that drivers are fairly compensated for the services they provide, while also maintaining the integrity and transparency of the payment process
